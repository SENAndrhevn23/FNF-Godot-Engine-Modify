## 🚀 Features

- Heavy **performance optimizations**
- **No note pooling**
- **Botplay support**
- Designed to handle large and complex charts

---

## 📄 JSON Support

This engine supports **JSON files** and can bypass Haxe’s JSON size limitation.

- Haxe JSON limit: ~**1.99 GB**
- 32-bit integer limit: **2,147,483,647 bytes (~2.1 GB)**

This allows extremely large charts and data files.

The chart editor and note system are planned to be reworked to support:
- **1–26 keys**
- Possibly **1–1000 keys** (experimental)

**Partially supported.**

Modcharts should mostly work, but:
- Some features may be limited

## 🎨 Shader Support

Shaders similar to Haxe’s **fragment (frag) format**:
- Possibly supported in the future
- Depends on feasibility and demand
